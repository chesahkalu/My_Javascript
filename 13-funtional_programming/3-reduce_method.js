 // Recude method : The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.

 // The reduce method can also take an optional second parameter to set an initial value for accumulator (remember, the first argument is the callback function!). If no initial value is specified, the first element is used as the initial value of accumulator and is never passed to the callback. See below:

 const array6 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations:
