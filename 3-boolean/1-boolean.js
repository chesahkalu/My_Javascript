When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false,

// Comparison with the Equality Operator
// There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value. 
// The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not.
// Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

/*In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion.
Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:        */

1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true

/*Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, 
the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion. If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.*/

//In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

typeof 3
typeof '3'

/*The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa.
Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.*/

Examples

1 !=  2    // true
1 != "1"   // false
1 != '1'   // false
1 != true  // false
0 != false // false

//Strict inequality (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa, and would not convert data types while comparing.

/*The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.*/

 it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.*/

 /*The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true.
 If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types. */

//Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

/*The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

/*When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. 
What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed. */
// Order matter when using if/else statements as if the first condition is true, the second condition will not be checked. So, it is better to put the condition that is more likely to be true first to avoid unnecessary checks.

//Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement:

    if (val > 10) {
      return "Greater than 10";
    }

//if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic:
function testSize(num) {
    if (num < 5) {
      return "Tiny";
    } else if (num < 10) {
      return "Small";
    } else if (num < 15) {

//If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:

if (val === 1) {
    answer = "a";
  } else if (val === 2) {
    answer = "b";
  } else {
    answer = "c";
  }

  switch (val) {
    case 1:
      answer = "a";
      break;
    case 2:
      answer = "b";
      break;
    default:
      answer = "c";
  }

//You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.

//Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
//But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b;
}




/*The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.

The syntax is a ? b : c, where a is the condition, b is the code to run when the condition returns true, and c is the code to run when the condition returns false.

The following function uses an if/else statement to check a condition:*/
