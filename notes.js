/*Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:  */

const cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};


// There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

// Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

const myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};

const prop1val = myObj.prop1;
const prop2val = myObj.prop2;

console.log(prop1val); // val1

// Bracket notation is what you use when you don't know ahead of time the name of the property you're trying to access, or when the name of the property is stored as a variable.
// Also, you can use bracket notation to access a property which has a space in its name. However, you must use bracket notation if the property name is numbers.

const myObj1 = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};

myObj1["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj1['More Space']; // Spock

const testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

const entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];
const drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];

// Accessing Object Properties with Variables
// Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
// Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

const dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt", Hunter: "Doberman", Snoopie: "Beagle"
};

const myDog = "Hunter";
const myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"

/*In this example, we have an object called dogs with different dog names as properties and their respective breeds as values. We also have a variable myDog which stores the name of a specific dog.
By using dogs[myDog], we can access the property value in the dogs object that corresponds to the value stored in myDog. In this case, myDog is "Hunter", so dogs[myDog] retrieves the value "Doberman".
It's important to note that when using the variable to access the property, we don't enclose the variable name in quotes. This is because we want to use the value stored in the variable, not the variable name itself.*/


// Updating Object Properties: Both dot and bracket notation can be used to update the value of an object's property.

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; // Dot notation
ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; // Bracket notation

// Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object: You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow"; // Dot notation
ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow"; // Bracket notation

// Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object: You can delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark; // Dot notation
delete ourDog["bark"]; // Bracket notation

console.log(ourDog)
