  /* Random Whole Number within a Range.

  Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

  To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.

  Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

  Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

  Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive. */

  function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin;
  }
